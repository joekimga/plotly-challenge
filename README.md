In this challenge, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which cataloged the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript were used to create the dashboard, D3 was used to read the json.file and Plotly was used to create the bubble chart.
