In this challenge, I  will built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript were used to create the dashboard, D3 was used to read the json.file and Plotly was used to create the bubble chart.
